              <p>
                If you're reading this, you probably care about building things.
                <br />
                Not just code, not just projects — but opportunities, confidence, change.
              </p>
  
              <p>That's what TinkerHub has always been about.</p>
  
              <p>
                When we started, we didn't have all the answers. We just knew one thing: there are brilliant people
                everywhere who never get a chance to realize how brilliant they are.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                The school system, the college system — they don't always encourage you to experiment, to break things, to
                learn at your own pace. Most of us are taught to memorize, not to explore.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                But something magical happens when you get the freedom to try.
                <br />
                The first time you write a program that actually works, ship a project with friends, or solve a problem
                that matters to you — something clicks.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                <strong>That spark is everything.</strong>
              </p>
            </div>
  
            <div className="space-y-6">
              <p>
                Over the last few years, we've been obsessed with that spark.
                <br />
                And somehow, a small idea grew into something massive:
              </p>
  
              <ul className="space-y-2 pl-6">
                <li>• 18,000+ makers who have tinkered, taught, and shared.</li>
                <li>• 1,000+ events where people have connected and collaborated.</li>
                <li>• Thousands of projects built and celebrated.</li>
                <li>• Careers started, startups launched, new confidence unlocked.</li>

                But the real story isn't in the numbers.
                <br />
                It's in the late-night debug sessions, the "aha!" moments, the friendships formed, the belief that grows
                every time someone realizes:

                  <br />
                  Wait — I actually made this work."
                </p>
              </div>
  
              <p>And here's the thing — we're just getting warmed up.</p>

            <div className="space-y-6">
              <p className="text-xl">Our vision isn't changing. If anything, it's expanding.</p>
  
              <p>
                We want more people — teenagers, students, professionals, lifelong learners — to have access to the tools,
                mentors, and environments that help them go from curious to capable.

                That's what TinkerSpace is about.
                <br />
                It's not just a room, not just a lab — it's a playground for builders.
                <br />A place to experiment, fail fast, learn faster, and be surrounded by others who care as much about
                your growth as you do.

                <strong>This is a new chapter for us — not a reset, not a farewell, but a bold step forward.</strong>

                Because this movement isn't about watching from the sidelines.
                <br />
                It's about rolling up your sleeves and making things real — together.
